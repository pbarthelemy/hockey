# Hockey Scoresheet Analyzer - Node.js App

A single-page web application for scraping and analyzing hockey game data from scoresheets.ca.

The game recap is another view of data otherwise available on scoresheets.

All the code is AI-generated (I am not a developer myself). I did spot-check the outputs, they are bug-free, as far as I saw... well, I think so... hope so...assume so...

The prediction piece is ... glorified guesswork.

It is based on a adaptation of the ELO ranking method used in CHESS, followed by more algorithms used in professional Baseball/Basketball (from [Nate Silver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Silver) with summary in [a post on Medium](https://medium.com/@sameerkoppolu/predicting-the-results-of-nba-matches-using-elo-rating-system-and-pythagorean-expectation-4b8ee6ec577)). It seems fancy, legit, serious and autoritative math stuff, but I have no clue what I am talking about, to be honest.

Do not trust the predictions blindly.

 To start with, there are not enough games in our league for true statistical significance. That is a obvious, factual caveat.
 
  And the formulae were adaptated from Basketball to Hockey by AI - I can not assess that for correctness (both the maths and the code are beyond my skillsets... 
  For instance, the _Pythagorean exponent is set 2.0_ : I really have no clue what that means, but AI said that is the best value for Hockey... yeah, sure...). 

Putting the puck in the net, and having fun doing it, that is all that matters, in the end!

## Installation

### Option 1: Local Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Option 2: Docker

1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t scoresheet-app .
```

2. Run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd)/csv:/app/csv -v $(pwd)/html:/app/html scoresheet-app
```

Or use Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Usage

### Local Development

1. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

Or for development with auto-reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Open your browser to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### Docker

Access the application at:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

To stop the container:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## How to Use

1. **Scrape Data**: Click "Scrape Data" button to fetch the latest games from scoresheets.ca
   - Note: Rate limited to once per hour for all users
   - Next allowed fetch time displayed below the button
2. **Select Filters**: Choose Tournament, Division, and Level from the dropdowns
3. **Analyze & Predict**: Click "Analyze & Predict" to generate:
   - Team results matrix with all game scores
   - Win/Loss/Tie statistics
   - ELO-based predictions for upcoming games
   - Team ELO ratings with historical prediction accuracy
4. **Validate Predictions**: Click "Validate Predictions" to test accuracy on historical data
5. **Download**: Click "Download CSV" to get the raw data file

## Rate Limiting

To avoid overloading the scoresheets.ca API:
- Scraping is limited to once per hour (server-wide)
- Last fetch time persists across server restarts
- UI shows when next fetch is allowed
Current system achieves **71.4% accuracy** on E.H.L. Moins de 15 ans B division.

## Parameter Optimization

TheGET /api/scrape/status` - Check if scraping is allowed (rate limit status)
- `POST /api/scrape` - Scrape games from scoresheets.ca (rate limited)
- `GET /api/filters` - Get available filter options
- `POST /api/analyze` - Analyze games with filters
- `POST /api/predict` - Generate ELO predictions
- `POST /api/validate` - Validate prediction accuracy
K_FACTOR = 35              // (was 20) - Faster ELO adjustments
HOME_ADVANTAGE = 100       // Home team bonus
PYTHAGOREAN_EXPONENT = 2.0 // (was 2.37) - Hockey-specific
ELO_WEIGHT = 0.8           // (was 0.6) - ELO vs Pythagorean
PYTH_WEIGHT = 0.2
```

To re-optimize parameters for your data:
```bash
python3 optimize_params.py
```

The validation feature tests the accuracy of the ELO prediction system by:
- Processing each completed game chronologically
- Using only data available before each game to make a prediction
- Comparing predictions to actual outcomes
- Calculating accuracy per team and overall

This provides insight into how reliable the predictions are for future games.
